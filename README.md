# Watch-and-Mobile-Phone-Detector-using-OpenVINO
This project demonstrates the use of OpenVINO (Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization) toolkit to detect watches and mobile phones in live camera feed. The model is trained to recognize these objects and provides real-time detection and classification.

# Usage
* Install OpenVINO toolkit and required dependencies.
* Download and compile the model using the OpenVINO Core API.
* Run the script to start the webcam and perform object detection.
